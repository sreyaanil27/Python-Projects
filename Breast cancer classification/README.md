**Project Introduction**:
        The goal of this project is to classify breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant, using a dataset of cell features. In addition to classification, the project also aims to understand the key features that distinguish benign tumors from malignant. By identifying these critical features, the project seeks to enhance predictive accuracy and provide insights into the factors that most significantly contribute to tumor malignancy.

**About the dataset**:
        The data set used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, which is publicly available in the Scikit-learn library. The data set consists 569 instances, each representing a breast cancer tumor, and consists of 30 different features describing the characteristics of a cell nuclei present in the tumors, such as radius, texture, area, smoothness, compactness and concavity.

**Tools Used**:
        The analysis and predictive modeling was implemented using Python, Using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-learn.

**Conclusion**:
        A predictive model  was built using Random Forest to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. Also the analysis revealed that features such as radius, perimeter, area and concave points tend to have significantly larger values in malignant tumors compared to benign ones. This indicates that tumors with larger size, irregular shapes or more pronounced concave points are more likely to be malignant. These insights can assist healthcare professionals by identifying key characteristics that are vital for early breast cancer detection and diagnosis, which could ultimately guide treatment strategies.
