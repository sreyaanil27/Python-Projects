                                                        Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction


        Customer churn, also known as customer attrition is the loss of clients or customers. Companies often use customer attrition analysis as one of their key business metrics, because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than the cost of acquiring a new one. 

        The objective of this project is to analyze the customer churn in a telecom company, to develop models to predict and customer churn and then provide actionable insights to improve customer retention. The dataset used is Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle which provides demographic information of the customer and the services they have signed up for. The project was implemented in Python using several libraries such as, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
