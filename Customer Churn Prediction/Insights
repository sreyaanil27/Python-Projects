									Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the insights derived from the customer churn analysis, the following strategies can be implemented to reduce churn and improve customer retention:

1. Encourage Longer Contracts:
	The analysis indicates that month-to-month contracts have the highest churn probability. To mitigate this, the company should encourage customers to opt for longer-term contracts, such as one-year or two-year plans, which show a significantly lower churn rate. Offering discounts or additional perks (such as exclusive offers, free services, or loyalty programs) can make these longer contracts more appealing to customers.


2. Offer Benefits to Senior Citizens:
	Senior citizens have a higher probability of churn. To address this, the company could introduce special discounts or customized services aimed at senior citizens, such as senior-friendly support, easy-to-use interfaces, and dedicated customer service channels. Additionally, tailored retention programs can be offered to increase engagement and satisfaction among this demographic.


3. Incentivize Customers Paying via Electronic Checks:
	Customers who use electronic checks as a payment method are more likely to churn. The company can offer payment incentives (like discounts or cashback) to encourage customers to opt for other payment methods, such as credit/debit cards or automatic bank transfers, which may offer better retention results.


4. Provide Benefits to High-Paying Customers:
	Customers paying higher charges might be at a higher risk of churn. To retain these valuable customers, the company can offer premium benefits such as exclusive access to new services, priority customer support, or free upgrades to enhance their overall experience. Rewarding high-paying customers with loyalty programs can help reduce their churn probability.


5. Focus on Online Security and Tech Support:
	Customers who have access to online security and tech support show a significantly lower churn rate. To capitalize on this, the company should ensure that these services are promoted effectively and made available to more customers. Offering free trials, bundle packages, or easy onboarding for online security and tech support services can help increase customer satisfaction and reduce churn.


6. Improve Customer Education and Engagement:
	Educating customers about the benefits of long-term contracts, online security, and tech support can increase their perceived value and reduce churn. Additionally, fostering a strong customer relationship through personalized communication and regular engagement via loyalty programs or exclusive deals can help the company retain customers in the long run.
